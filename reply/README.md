# Reply :heart: Flutter

> Reply is an email app that uses Material Design components and Material Theming to create an on-brand communication experience.

This project tries to deliver a pixel-perfect implementation of the [Reply Material Design Case Study](https://material.io/design/material-studies/reply.html) in [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter). 
The focus lies on the UI (animation, layout, transition, etc.) and should showcase how
powerful Flutter has become as a UI framework.

## Getting Started

To install the app on your phone you have two options. For Android you can download a pre-compiled 
APK file from the ['Releases'](https://github.com/flschweiger/reply/releases) tab or use the this [direct link](https://github.com/flschweiger/reply/releases/download/v1.0.0/reply-release.apk).

You can also download and build the project locally - for this you need to have a local Flutter installation. 
Just clone the project and inside the root execute `flutter run --profile`.
This will compile and install the app on your connected device / emulator / simulator.
Also make sure to enable slow animations :wink:


## Design Resources

Currently most of the work is done with the resources you can find on the [official Material page](https://material.io/design/material-studies/reply.html). For some animated icons 2Dimensions' Flare was used, you can find the design files [here](https://www.2dimensions.com/a/flschweiger/files/recent/all).
